#       "In the lore that has built up around autosave, 
#        PV's that should be restored only before record
#        initialization have been termed "positions".
#        All other PV's have been termed "settings".
#
#        Thus, you might run across a file called
#        'auto_positions.req', and now you'll know that 
#        the parameters in this file are intended to be 
#        restored only during autosave's pass-0."
